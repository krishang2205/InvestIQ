This repository utilizes a **Monorepo** structure separating the frontend application from the backend services.

## Directory Structure

-   **`frontend/`**: The React-based user interface (Vite + React).
-   **`backend/`**: Server-side code and API services (Planned).

## Getting Started

### Frontend

To run the frontend application:

1.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies (if needed):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Backend

*Coming soon.*
